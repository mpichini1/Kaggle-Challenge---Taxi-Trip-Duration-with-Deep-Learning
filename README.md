# Kaggle-Challenge-Taxi-Trip-Duration-with-Deep-Learning
In this competition, Kaggle is challenging you to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. 

This work was made in collaboration with Andrea Piancone and Valentina Nelli. We addressed this challenge using Fully Connected Neural Networks, exploiting Optuna Library for Hyperparameters Optimization. Our goal it was to find out the best solutions in terms of MSE mantaining a small models capable to run on less_powerfull devices.
